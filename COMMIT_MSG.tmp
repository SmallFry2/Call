feat(dx): initial project scaffolding and configuration

this initial commit establishes a robust foundation for the project, focusing on developer experience (dx) and modern configuration standards. it addresses several inconsistencies and sets up the monorepo for scalable contributions.

- vscode & editor config:
  - introduced `.vscode/settings.json` and `extensions.json` to enforce consistent formatting (prettier on save) and recommend essential extensions. this minimizes style drift and lowers the barrier for new contributors.
  - added `.gitattributes` to normalize line endings (lf), preventing cross-platform git noise.

- typescript & build integrity:
  - resolved a series of cascading typescript errors stemming from the monorepo setup. corrected the `tsconfig.json` `extends` to use a relative path, as module path aliases aren't resolved for this property.
  - updated the shared `nextjs.json` config with `jsx: "react-jsx"` and `jsxImportSource: "react"`. this is critical for react 19's jsx transform and ensures the compiler can correctly resolve jsx typings across the workspace.

- baseline cleanup:
  - refactored the boilerplate `page.tsx` to provide a cleaner, more structured starting point for the web application.

this groundwork ensures the project is stable, easy to work with, and ready for feature development.
